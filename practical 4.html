    <h2>Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyengar[a] FRS (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Indian Empire. Despite having almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.</h2>
